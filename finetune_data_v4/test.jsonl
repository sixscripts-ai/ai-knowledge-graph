It serves as a precision entry level within the Order Block zone. Instead of entering at the first touch of the OB, waiting for price to reach the Mean Threshold gives you a deeper entry with tighter risk. Smart money often respects this level because it represents the average price at which institutional orders were filled. If price trades through the Mean Threshold and closes beyond the OB body on a candle basis, the OB is likely invalidated. The Mean Threshold is to Order Blocks what Consequent Encroachment is to Fair Value Gaps \u2014 a 50% precision level."}]}

Key correlations: EUR/USD and GBP/USD are positively correlated \u2014 they should move together. If one makes a new low and the other doesn't, that's SMT Divergence signaling a reversal. DXY (Dollar Index) is inversely correlated with EUR/USD \u2014 dollar strength means euro weakness. ES (S&P) and NQ (Nasdaq) should move together \u2014 divergence between them signals institutional activity. Bond yields affect equity and forex markets. Use intermarket analysis for bias confirmation \u2014 if EUR/USD is bearish and DXY is bullish, your bias has multi-instrument support. Conflicting signals across markets mean sit on your hands and wait for clarity."}]}

It's calculated as (Swing High + Swing Low) / 2. Equilibrium acts as a key reference: price often consolidates around equilibrium before making its next institutional move. In a bullish scenario, you want to buy when price is below equilibrium (in discount) and target liquidity above equilbrium (in premium). In a bearish scenario, sell in premium and target liquidity in discount. Equilibrium applies at every timeframe \u2014 a daily swing has its own EQ, and within that, an H1 swing has its own. Understanding which zone you're in prevents the common mistake of buying high and selling low."}]}

This is significant because it shows that the imbalance was so aggressively addressed that institutions didn't wait \u2014 they immediately moved to rebalance the price. An IRB provides an ultra-short-term entry: enter as the rebalance candle touches the FVG and target the continuation in the displacement direction. IRBs are most common during volatile Kill Zone periods and around news events. They require fast execution because the opportunity window is compressed to a single candle."}]}

When price posts two or more highs at nearly the same level, retail traders see 'strong resistance' and place sell stops just below and breakout buys just above. This creates a dense cluster of orders. Same with Equal Lows \u2014 retail sees 'strong support' and stacks orders around them. Smart money sees these as targets, not barriers. Equal highs are buy-side liquidity targets; equal lows are sell-side liquidity targets. The more 'equal' the highs or lows (closer in price), the more concentrated the stops and the more attractive the target for institutions. When equal highs/lows get raided, expect a reversal \u2014 the liquidity has been captured."}]}

When price enters an HRLZ, it typically slows down, consolidates, or reverses because there are too many institutional reference points opposing the move. HRLZs are the opposite of Low Resistance Liquidity Runs. Identifying them helps you set realistic targets: don't expect price to blow through an HRLZ quickly. If your target is beyond an HRLZ, consider taking partial profits before it or wait for a clear break through the zone before adding to your position."}]}

It occurs when price violates a short-term swing point against the prevailing trend \u2014 but without strong displacement. For example, in a bullish trend making HH/HL, a CHoCH happens when price dips below a recent higher low without conviction. It's weaker than a full Market Structure Shift because it lacks displacement and may not indicate a true reversal. CHoCH tells you to be cautious \u2014 stop adding to the current trend direction, tighten stops, and watch for a full MSS confirmation. Many CHoCH signals resolve with the trend continuing, which is why you don't trade them alone."}]}

It marks where institutions placed sell orders that initiated the sell-off. The candle must be bullish (close above open), followed by strong bearish displacement that breaks structure and ideally creates Fair Value Gaps. The tradeable zone is the body of that bullish candle \u2014 from its open up to its high. When price retraces up to this zone, expect resistance as institutional sell orders are still resting there. The most reliable Bearish OBs are in premium zones above equilibrium. Always validate with displacement \u2014 no displacement means no valid OB."}]}

Unlike a standard OB (which is the last opposing candle before displacement), a Propulsion Block is a candle within the displacement itself that acts as a launching pad. When price retraces to a Propulsion Block, it tends to 'propel' price back in the displacement direction with force. Think of it as a fuel stop within an institutional move. Propulsion Blocks are especially useful when the standard Order Block is too far away for an efficient entry \u2014 the Propulsion Block gives you a closer entry point within the move itself."}]}

Many traders increase position sizes after wins (overconfidence) or after losses (revenge trading) \u2014 both destroy accounts. ICT advocates keeping your risk percentage fixed (1-2% per trade) and letting your absolute dollar risk grow naturally as your account grows. If you're on a losing streak, the Two Strike Rule stops you before significant damage. If you're winning, your account grows and 1% of a larger account equals larger positions automatically. The goal: a smooth, upward-sloping equity curve without the spikes and crashes that come from emotional position sizing."}]}
