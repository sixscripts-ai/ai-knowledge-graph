The narrative is that smart money already knows the outcome (or has positioned for multiple scenarios) and uses the volatility injection from news to capture liquidity and execute their plan. Price was already headed toward its target; news just provides the catalyst and volume to get there faster. Practically: avoid entering during high-impact news (30 minutes before/after). But use the post-news displacement as confirmation. If news creates a sweep of liquidity and then displacement in the opposite direction, that aligns with the Judas Swing concept. The move after news settles is often the tradeable move."}]}

This is because the weekly Power of Three typically completes its manipulation phase by Tuesday. Monday usually continues the previous week's action or consolidates (accumulation). Tuesday's manipulation sweep often captures weekly liquidity \u2014 either sweeping the previous week's high or low \u2014 establishing the week's extreme. Once Tuesday's liquidity event has occurred, Wednesday through Friday are the distribution phase where the true weekly move plays out. Practically, this means: if Tuesday makes a significant low after sweeping sell-side liquidity, expect a bullish weekly move from Wednesday onward. If Tuesday sweeps a high, expect bearish distribution."}]}

A candle that looks like an OB but isn't followed by strong, impulsive price movement away from it is a False OB. Other signs: no FVG was created after the supposed OB, the move away was gradual rather than explosive, or the 'OB' formed outside a Kill Zone. False OBs are common during choppy, range-bound conditions (like the Dead Zone). If price returns to a supposed OB and slices right through it without even a wick rejection, it was never a real OB \u2014 institutions didn't place orders there. Before trading any Order Block, verify: Was there displacement? Did it create an FVG? Did it form during a Kill Zone? If not, it's likely false."}]}

Measure the range of the initial leg (manipulation move or first expansion swing). Then project multiples: -1.0 SD equals the same distance, -2.0 SD is double, -2.5 SD is 2.5x the distance. The -2.5 SD level is statistically the most significant \u2014 price often terminates here. Use the formula: Target = Reference Point - (Leg Range \u00d7 SD Multiple) for bearish, or + for bullish. SD projections are applied to CBDR ranges, Asian Range expansions, and Judas Swing legs. They give you concrete profit targets instead of guessing where price will stop."}]}

For example, a bullish FVG that was supposed to act as support but gets traded through becomes a bearish IFVG that now acts as resistance. This state change is significant because it tells you that institutional commitment has shifted. When price returns to test the IFVG from the other side, expect a reaction. IFVGs are particularly powerful when they align with a Market Structure Shift, confirming that the market has changed direction."}]}

The -2.5 SD level is the statistically most significant target \u2014 the 'terminus' where price often exhausts. Direction is determined by higher timeframe bias.
