The process: 1) Enter full position at your PD array entry (OB/FVG). 2) When price reaches the first significant level (1.0 SD, or 50% of the way to your final target), take 50-80% off. 3) Move your stop to breakeven on the remaining position. 4) Let the runner target the final DOL (2.0-2.5 SD, or the opposing liquidity pool). This protects your profits while giving you exposure to the full move. The psychological benefit is huge: knowing you've already banked profit lets you hold the runner calmly. Never move your stop to breakeven before taking partials \u2014 that's the quickest way to get stopped out flat."}]}

The IPDA has two primary directives: seek liquidity (resting orders at predictable levels) and rebalance inefficiencies (fill FVGs and tested PD arrays). It operates on three data ranges: Short-term (20-day lookback for recent swing reference), Intermediate (40-day lookback for context), and Long-term (60-day lookback for major levels). The algorithm delivers price from one liquidity pool to another, filling FVGs along the way. Every concept in ICT \u2014 Kill Zones, PD arrays, market structure \u2014 is a lens for reading the IPDA's intentions. Understanding the IPDA means understanding that price is engineered, not random."}]}

These runs occur when there are few unfilled FVGs, no significant Order Blocks, and no major liquidity pools in the path. Price can move quickly through these zones because there's nothing to slow it down. Recognizing an LRLR helps you understand why price sometimes moves in a straight line without retracing \u2014 there are no obstacles. Conversely, when price approaches a zone with dense PD arrays (stacked OBs, unfilled FVGs), expect it to slow down, react, or reverse. LRLRs are common during expansion phases of the Power of Three and during strong trend days."}]}

You spot a sweep by looking for a wick that penetrates a level without a body close beyond it \u2014 price pokes through, grabs the stops, and snaps back. The sweep creates a 'wick' on the chart. Another telltale: volume spikes during the sweep as all those stops get triggered simultaneously. Sweeps are the mechanism behind the Judas Swing and manipulation phase. After a sweep, look for displacement in the opposite direction \u2014 that confirms smart money got what they needed (liquidity fill) and are now moving price in their intended direction."}]}

Second, the 3-trade daily maximum caps your activity. Third, the Two Strike Rule stops you after two consecutive losses. Fourth, the pre-trade scoring system prevents entering weak setups. Fifth, the A+ template requires seven confluences \u2014 most market conditions don't meet this bar. Sixth, Model 9 (One Shot One Kill) philosophically limits you to 1-2 trades per WEEK. Overtrading is usually driven by boredom, FOMO, or revenge. ICT's structure makes overtrading physically difficult to do if you follow the rules. The traders who struggle with overtrading haven't fully committed to the framework."}]}

The tighter the CBDR, the more confident you can be in an explosive move."}]}

It creates a zone where both bullish and bearish FVGs overlap \u2014 essentially price traded through both sides of a level. The overlapping area of these opposing FVGs is the BPR. This zone is significant because it represents a truly 'balanced' area where both buyers and sellers have transacted. The midpoint of the BPR acts as a strong reaction level. BPRs are useful for re-entry when you missed the initial move \u2014 they give you a second chance to enter at a fair price after a liquidity sweep."}]}

No exceptions. The logic: two losses in a row means either your bias is wrong, you're not reading the market correctly, or conditions are unfavorable. Continuing to trade in this state leads to revenge trading and compounding losses. After two strikes, close your charts, review your journal, and prepare for the next day. Combined with the maximum 3 trades per day rule, the Two Strike Rule protects your capital and psychology. Most of a trader's biggest losing days happen when they refuse to stop after early losses. The rule prevents catastrophic drawdowns."}]}
