There are four main Kill Zones: the Asian session (8:00 PM - 12:00 AM EST), London Open (2:00 AM - 5:00 AM EST), New York AM (8:30 AM - 11:00 AM EST), and New York PM (1:30 PM - 4:00 PM EST). Smart money operates during these windows because that's when volume and volatility peak. Trading outside Kill Zones dramatically reduces your probability. The London and NY AM sessions are typically the highest probability Kill Zones for ICT setups."}]}

It's named after the biblical betrayal because price 'lies' about its true intention. The Judas Swing sweeps liquidity (triggers stops) on one side before reversing aggressively in the true direction. For example, price might spike above the Asian session high, triggering buy stops, then reverse sharply downward. This false breakout traps traders on the wrong side while giving smart money the liquidity they need to fill their real orders."}]}

Candle 2 is typically a large displacement candle that creates this imbalance. The FVG zone is the area between the high of candle 1's wick and the low of candle 3's wick (for bullish FVGs), or vice versa for bearish. Mark this zone on your chart \u2014 price will likely return to fill it. Unfilled FVGs below current price on higher timeframes are especially significant."}]}

You help traders understand ICT methodology with clear, practical explanations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is liquidity in ICT methodology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In ICT methodology, liquidity refers to clusters of stop-loss orders resting at predictable price levels. Buy-side liquidity (BSL) sits above swing highs and equal highs, where buy stops and breakout orders accumulate. Sell-side liquidity (SSL) sits below swing lows and equal lows, where sell stops rest. Smart money needs this liquidity to fill their large institutional orders \u2014 they can't enter massive positions without sufficient counterparty volume. Understanding where liquidity rests is fundamental to ICT because price is drawn to these pools before reversals. The market is essentially an engine that seeks liquidity."}]}

Should I take it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No \u2014 3:00 PM EST is at the tail end of the NY PM Kill Zone and approaching the close of institutional activity for the day. The highest probability trades occur during London Open (2-5 AM EST) and NY AM (8:30-11 AM EST). Taking setups at 3 PM means you're trading when institutional volume is declining and the day's primary moves have likely already occurred. Additionally, the 2:00-8:00 PM window is the CBDR period \u2014 this is when smart money is accumulating for the NEXT session's move, not creating tradeable setups. Wait for tomorrow's Kill Zone instead."}]}
