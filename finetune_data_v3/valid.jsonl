It's not visible on any indicator \u2014 you read it through market structure, displacement, and how price interacts with Order Blocks and FVGs. IOF follows the higher timeframe directional bias established on the Daily and Weekly charts. When IOF is bullish, price makes higher lows that get respected and higher highs that get broken. When IOF is bearish, higher highs get rejected and lower lows get targeted. Understanding IOF means understanding the 'why' behind gap creation and price movement \u2014 it's the institutional sponsorship model that drives everything in ICT."}]}

Without displacement, it's just a random candle. An OB becomes invalid (or 'broken') when price trades through it completely on a closing basis. Key validation criteria: the displacement should create at least one Fair Value Gap, confirming institutional involvement. The Order Block should align with higher timeframe bias. It should occur during a Kill Zone for maximum probability. An OB that has been tested once and held is stronger than an untested one. Order Blocks on higher timeframes (H1, H4, Daily) carry more institutional weight."}]}

On your chart, mark every obvious swing high \u2014 those are liquidity targets. Equal highs are especially potent because double tops create concentrated stop clusters. Sell-side liquidity forms below swing lows, equal lows, and obvious support levels. Equal lows are powerful SSL targets. To use this: ask yourself 'where are the stops?' Price will move toward those stops. Once liquidity is swept (stops triggered), price often reverses. This is the foundation of the Judas Swing and manipulation concepts."}]}

This gives you the direction you want to trade. Then move to the H1 to identify key levels \u2014 Order Blocks, FVGs, and liquidity pools that align with the HTF bias. Finally, drop to M15 or M5 for entry timing. The key rule: the lower timeframe must align with the higher timeframe view via a Market Structure Shift before you enter. If HTF is bullish but LTF is still bearish, wait. Don't enter until the LTF shifts to confirm the HTF view."}]}
