Fourth, treating FVGs and Order Blocks as automatic entries \u2014 these are reference points, not signals. You need displacement and MSS confirmation.

Manipulation typically occurs during specific times \u2014 particularly around London Open (2:00-5:00 AM EST) and around significant economic events. The key tell: manipulation creates a false move in the opposite direction of the true daily bias. It involves techniques like spiking below SSL to fill buy orders, or above BSL to fill sells.
