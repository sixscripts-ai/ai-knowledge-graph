Institutional portfolio rebalancing occurs at quarter boundaries, where funds reallocate capital across asset classes. This creates significant shifts in order flow that can reverse multi-month trends. March-April transitions are particularly significant as they coincide with fiscal year-end for many institutions. These shifts often manifest as major swing points on weekly/monthly charts. For practical trading, be especially cautious at quarter boundaries: trends that seemed unstoppable may reverse as institutional flows change. Combine with seasonal tendencies for higher-timeframe directional bias."}]}

Outside Kill Zones, price action is often just noise \u2014 random movement without institutional direction. When you trade during Kill Zones, you align with the times when smart money is active, which means Order Blocks and FVGs are more likely to be respected, displacement moves are genuine, and setups have institutional sponsorship. The Kill Zones also align with major economic data releases and session opens, which create the volatility and liquidity that make ICT setups work. Trading outside these times is gambling."}]}

This gap represents institutional positioning that occurred over the weekend when retail traders couldn't participate. NWOGs act as significant reference levels throughout the trading week \u2014 they function like magnets that price is drawn toward. The midpoint of a NWOG (the 50% level between the gap's high and low) is especially important as a support/resistance level. When price trades through a NWOG, it often signals strong institutional commitment in that direction. NWOGs rank in the PD Array Matrix after Mitigation Blocks."}]}
