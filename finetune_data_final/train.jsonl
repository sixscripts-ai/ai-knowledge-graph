The Sunday open also helps identify the New Week Opening Gap (NWOG) \u2014 the difference between Friday's close and Sunday's open. When combined with Tuesday's high/low significance, the Sunday open gives you context: has the market gapped above Friday's close (bullish sentiment shift)? Has it gapped below (bearish)?

The philosophy: quantity of trades doesn't matter, quality does. Model 9 requires waiting for the week's highest-probability setup and executing with precision. The sequence: 1) Weekly analysis to determine the week's likely bias and target (using Sunday open, weekly market structure, HTF PD arrays). 2) Wait for Tuesday's high/low establishment. 3) Identify the optimal entry using a confluence-rich setup during a Kill Zone. 4) Execute one trade targeting 50-75 pips. 5) Once achieved, you're done for the week. The discipline of Model 9 prevents overtrading and forces you to be selective. The target of 50-75 pips per week compounds to exceptional annual returns."}]}

It looks like a consolidation or minor pullback that retests PD arrays (OBs, FVGs) before continuing the uptrend. Redistribution is the bearish counterpart \u2014 a pause within a downtrend where smart money adds to shorts before the next leg down. Both are distinct from accumulation/distribution at trend extremes: reaccumulation happens mid-trend (bullish), redistribution happens mid-trend (bearish). Identifying these correctly prevents you from taking counter-trend trades during what is actually a healthy trend continuation. Key tell: during reaccumulation/redistribution, internal range liquidity gets addressed (FVGs filled, OBs tested) before the trend resumes."}]}

It's essentially a failed breakout that captures liquidity. A bearish SFP: price wicks above a swing high (triggering buy stops) but the candle body closes back below the high. A bullish SFP: price wicks below a swing low (triggering sell stops) but closes back above. SFPs are powerful reversal signals because they combine a liquidity sweep with an immediate failure. They confirm that smart money used the breakout to fill orders in the opposite direction. SFPs at equal highs/lows or during Kill Zones are especially high-probability."}]}

Continuing to trade in this state leads to revenge trading and compounding losses. After two strikes, close your charts, review your journal, and prepare for the next day.

For example, a bullish FVG that was supposed to act as support but gets traded through becomes a bearish IFVG that now acts as resistance. This state change is significant because it tells you that institutional commitment has shifted. When price returns to test the IFVG from the other side, expect a reaction. IFVGs are particularly powerful when they align with a Market Structure Shift, confirming that the market has changed direction."}]}

Pre-session (night before): determine daily bias from HTF analysis, measure CBDR, identify key liquidity targets. Asian session: monitor accumulation, note the range high/low. London Open (2-5 AM EST): watch for Judas Swing manipulation, identify entry setups. NY AM (8:30-11 AM EST): execute primary trades during the distribution phase, target 20-75 pips depending on your model (12/11/9). Dead Zone (11-12:30 PM): no trading, review. NY PM (1:30-4 PM EST): secondary setups only, lighter position sizes. Post-session: journal, analyze, prepare for tomorrow. The Day Trading Model is the master schedule that all other ICT models operate within."}]}
