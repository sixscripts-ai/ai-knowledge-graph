Fourth, treating FVGs and Order Blocks as automatic entries \u2014 these are reference points, not signals. You need displacement and MSS confirmation.

It includes stop hunts, fake breakouts, Judas Swings, and spikes below sell-side liquidity. Manipulation typically occurs during specific times \u2014 particularly around London Open (2:00-5:00 AM EST) and around significant economic events. The key tell: manipulation creates a false move in the opposite direction of the true daily bias. It involves techniques like spiking below SSL to fill buy orders, or above BSL to fill sells. Understanding manipulation is Phase 2 of the Power of Three \u2014 between accumulation and distribution. Your goal is to recognize manipulation in real-time and position yourself for the distribution phase."}]}

It's weaker than a full Market Structure Shift because it lacks displacement and may not indicate a true reversal. CHoCH tells you to be cautious \u2014 stop adding to the current trend direction, tighten stops, and watch for a full MSS confirmation. Many CHoCH signals resolve with the trend continuing, which is why you don't trade them alone."}]}
